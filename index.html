                    <p>I'd like to take a moment to voice my opinions on HTML formatting...</p>

                        I like to code HTML,<br>
                        But Javascript can go to, well,<br>
                        &emsp;A different file,<br>
                        &emsp;And wait a while,<br>
                        CSS can go as well.

                <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>I'm interested in sports, now more than ever, because my wife and I recently had a son, Clyde, and I want to be active with him as he grows up.
                        My own father lost his left leg in a motorcycle accident shortly before I was born, and due to no fault of his own, he wasn't able to play sports with us.
                        As I have spent the last couple of years learning to play volleyball, basketball and a little baseball, I've discovered something I missed out on, that I want my son to have.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm also interested in music. Growing up we had a piano in the house, but I never studied seriously.
                        My mother tried to teach me the basics, but I was obstinate and fought against her.
                        In my late teens I learned to play by ear and improvise, and became somewhat skilled at composition.
                        Recently, however, I have been teaching myself sight reading, and although it is difficult, I have found it highly rewarding.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am interested in the entire process of game design and development, though I have approached the field from odd and inefficient angles.
                        The first language I learned was Java, and I used the Swing library to build dozens of simple games.
                        I later learned C#, and used the .Net and GDI frameworks to write more complicated games and world building tools.
                        Looking back, I feel like I might have spent my time better learning dedicated gaming frameworks, especially those that offer relatively easy GPU access.
                        It is my hope at some point to realize some of the more mature game ideas that have been knocking around my head for years, and I believe fluency in C++ and modern audio/visual/IO libraries will help me toward that goal.
                    </p>
